Classes: 
Both code snippets use classes (Song, MusicLibrary, and Playlist). 
This is a good choice for representing entities in an object-oriented manner.

Data Structures:
main.py: Uses a combination of classes and lists (for the song_list attribute in the Playlist class).
MusicLibrary: Uses a combination of classes and dictionaries (for the song_list attribute in the MusicLibrary class).

Song Representation:
Both the codes have a "Song" class to represent each of the songs with the display of the title of the song, artist, album, 
genre, and the length.

Music Library Representation:
main.py: Uses a dictionary (song_list) in the MusicLibrary class to store songs with a key based on title and artist.
MusicLibrary.py: Also uses a dictionary (song_list) in the MusicLibrary class, but the key is based on title and artist.

Playlist Representation:
main.py: Uses a list (song_list) in the Playlist class to store songs.
MusicLibrary.py: Also uses a list (song_list) in the Playlist class to store songs.
